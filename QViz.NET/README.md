1. Make sure you have the **.NET Core version 3** or later installed in the Local system.
2. Clone this Repository in any User accessible location: `git clone <repository-url>`
3. Switch to the Repository location: `cd <repository-folder-name>\QViz.NET`
4. Install the NuGet packages and build the Project: `dotnet build QViz.NET.sln`
5. Run the Unit Tests: `dotnet test QViz.NET.sln`

## Deploying the NuGet Package
The following are the steps for deploying the QViz.NET SDK Package in the NuGet Repository:

dotnet build QViz.NET.sln --configuration Release

dotnet nuget push "Periscope.QViz/bin/Release/Periscope.QViz.VERSION.nupkg" --source "periscope-tech"
```
